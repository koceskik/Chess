Java Networked (sockets) Chess program. Provides 1-vs-1 chess matches 
(random piece assignment) and bughouse (2-vs-2) chess (random piece and 
partner assignment).

Note: bughouse is currently nonfunctional. As is, there are just 2 
boards being played at the same time (ie pieces are not passed between 
boards yet).
