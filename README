Java Networked (sockets) Chess program. Provides 1-vs-1 chess matches 
(random piece assignment) and bughouse (2-vs-2) chess (random piece and 
partner assignment).

Bughouse is fully functional. Taken pieces are transferred to the player's partner who can use the piece on his next turn. The winner of chess and bughouse matches is distinguished by the turn counter bordering the winner in blue.
